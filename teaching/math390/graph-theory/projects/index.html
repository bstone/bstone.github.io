<p>The final project for this course involves giving a talk on a topic related to Graph Theory. You can work in groups of 2 or 3 people, or you can work by yourself. Here is some basic information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>• The talk should be about 5 minutes + 5 minutes/person (for example, one person should give a 10 minute talk, and two people should give a 15 minute talk).</li>
  <li>• The talk must use computer slides (such as PowerPoint, Beamer, or JavaScript).</li>
</ul>

<p>The presentations will occur on Monday, May 16 during the scheduled final exam time.</p>

<p>Your talk should focus on explaining the main ideas of your topic clearly, so that the audience (the other members of the class) can understand it. For some of the topics listed below, there is too much material to present in the given time — in that case, you should choose some part of the material to present.</p>

<h2 id="important-dates">Important dates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>• <strong>May 2:</strong> Tell me who is in your group and what topic you are presenting. Each group must have a different topic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>• <strong>May 16:</strong> Presentation during the final exam time.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="possible-topics">Possible Topics</h2>

<p>Below you will find a list of possible topics with at least one reference. Most, if not all, of the references are on reserve in the library. When researching the projects, don’t limit yourselves to the references below; feel free to find more information from other resources. Also, you are free to choose topics not on this list, but you must approve the topic with me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>(Taken)</em> <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem">Stable Matchings</a>:</strong> See Section 9.3 of the book <em>Introductory Combinatorics</em> by Brualdi. The 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics went to Shapley and Roth for their work on Stable Matchings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_switching_game">The Shannon Switching Game</a>:</strong> See Section 11.6 in <em>Introductory Combinatorics</em> by Brualdi.  This is a game played on a graph where one player tries to create a path between two specified vertices, while another player tries to remove edges to prevent the first player from succeeding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope">Polytopes</a>:</strong> See <em>Discrete and Computational Geometry</em> by Devadoss and O’Rourke.  We have talked some about polytopes in class but there are many more things one can ask – Why are there only five Platonic polyhedra in 3-dimensions?  What are the regular polytopes in higher dimesions? Could a polyhedron be flexible (while maintaining its edge lengths)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory">Ramsey Theory</a>:</strong> See Section 8.3 of <em>Introduction to Graph Theory</em> by West. Ramsey Theory generalizes the dinner party problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_graph">Random Graphs</a>:</strong> See Section 8.5 of <em>Introduction to Graph Theory</em> by West. A random graph on (n) vertices is created by randomly deciding whether each possible edge is in the graph or not.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eigenvalues of Graphs:</strong> Section 8.6 of <em>Introduction to Graph Theory</em> by West. The eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of a graph can tell us things about the graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Proof of the Classification of Surfaces:</strong> See Appendix C of <em>Shape of Space</em> by Weeks.  In class, we learned that all surfaces are either a connected sum of tori or projective planes, but we did not prove this fact.  This book provides a nice proof of this fact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprouts_(game)">The Game of Sprouts:</a></strong> See <a href="../docs/GraphTheoryandtheGameofSprouts.pdf">Graph Theory and the Game of Sprouts</a> by Mark Copper.  This is a game where players take turns adding an edge and a vertex to a graph in a specified way.  In addition to reading the above paper, I recommend trying to determine if there is an optimal strategy that allows the first player (or second player) to win if the game begins with 2 vertices or 3 vertices?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Minimum Weight Matchings:</strong>  If you have a weighted bipartite graph, you may want to find a matching with minimum weight.  This problem is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem">Assignment Problem</a> and an algorithm to solve it is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm">Hungarian Algorithm</a>.  See Sections 8.3 and 8.4 of <em>Introduction to Operations Research</em> by Hillier and Lieberman.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi Diagram</a>:</strong> See <a href="http://www.pi6.fernuni-hagen.de/downloads/publ/tr198.pdf">Voronoi Diagrams</a> by Aurenhammer and Klein. Consider a set of (n) points in the plane.  The Voronoi diagram of this set of points partitions the plane into (n) regions, with each region corresponding to a point.  The region corresponding to a given point is all points in the plane that are closer to that point than to the other points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Simplex Algorithm and Linear Programming:</strong> Sections 8.1-8.3 of <em>Linear Algebra and its Applications</em> by Strang (you can get this book from me). The simplex algorithm provides a method of optimizing a quantity over the solutions to a system of linear inequalities.  This is related to network flows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ridigity of Bar Frameworks:</strong>  A bar framework is a graph in the plane (or in 3-dimensions) where the vertices are free to move around as long as the lengths of the edges remain constant.  See pages 74-75 of Edition 5 of the textbook and also see the book <em>Counting on Frameworks</em> by Graver.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_gallery_problem">The Art Gallery Problem</a>:</strong> See Chapter 35 of <em>Proofs from THE BOOK</em> by Aigner and Ziegler.  This is about determining the minimum number of guards needed to guard an art gallery so that together they can observe the whole art gallery.</p>
