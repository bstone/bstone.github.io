<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Website.</strong> 
The website for the course is <a href="http://math.adelphi.edu/~bstone/teaching/math142/">http://math.adelphi.edu/~bstone/teaching/math142/</a>.  All homework assignments will be posted on this site as well as solutions to quizzes, exams, and other resources and materials.  <strong>We will not be using Moodle for this course.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>On-line Homework Utility (WeBWork).</strong> 
We will be using an on-line homework system to handle some of the routine and practice problems. Point your browser of choice to <a href="https://webworks.adelphi.edu/webwork2/">https://webworks.adelphi.edu/webwork2/</a> and click on “Stone-2015F-Math-142-Calc-II”. You will be using WeBWorK for the Gateway exams as well as working the preview activities from the book.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Text.</strong> <em><a href="http://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/books/10/"><strong>Active Calculus</strong></a></em> written by Matthew Boelkins (Grand Valley State University), David Austin (Grand Valley State University), and Steven Schlicker (Grand Valley State University). You can find the whole text in the above link.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Calculators.</strong>  You will not need a graphing calculator in this course. However, you should have access to a scientific calculator; no particular model is required. The use of calculators is usually permitted on quizzes and exams. Most smart phones have calculator apps, but the use of phones and other network-enabled devices during quizzes and exams is prohibited.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Writing Assignments.</strong> There will be three writing assignments throughout the semester. These assignments will vary in length depending on the project.  All writing assignments are to be written in LaTeX.  The requirements and expectations of each project will be outlined when the assignment is given. The purpose of these assignments is to help you reflect on the content of this course and to help you internalize the material.
<br />
<br /></li>
  <li><strong>Preview Activities.</strong> We will use the on-line system WeBWorK to deal with the assigning and grading of preview activities from the text.  Before each new topic, an assignment will be given via WeBWorK.  You will be responsible to learn the basics of this material before the activities in class. You may retake these problems as many times as you want between the time they are assigned and the closing date. Each assignment will close the at the beginning of class the day the topic is introduced.
<br />
<br /></li>
  <li><strong>Assessment Activities.</strong> Periodically there will be Assessment Activities in class. You can find them scheduled on the calendar. These activities are a way for me, the professor, the gain some understanding as to what your understanding is at that point. Anyone who participates in the Assessment Activity will receive full marks for that activity. In other words, there is no penalty for getting a wrong answer. You should view these activities as a way to get feed back from me as to how you are progressing in the course. There is no make up for missing an Assessment Activity. 
<br />
<br /></li>
  <li><strong>Gateway Exams.</strong> There will be two Gateway exams in this course. One dealing with differentiation and the other with integration. These exams are proctored outside of the classroom in the Learning Center. While the exam is open, you as many chances to pass the exam as you can obtain. Of course you are limited by the times in which the Learning Center is open. <strong>The derivative gateway will be open August 31 - September 25; the integral gateway is open October 5 - October 30.</strong> These exams will be given through the WeBWorK system. As such, you may practice the exam at home as many times as you want before you take the exam in the Learning Center.  Gateway exams are 30 minutes in length and are graded out of 7 questions. You must answer 6 questions correctly in order to pass the exam. 
<br />
<br />
In order to see your score during the proctored exam, you must have the following information.</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grading Username:</strong> grade</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grading passward:</strong> gateway
<br />
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Exams.</strong> There will be a total of two exams in the course. Both exams will be comprehensive. The exam dates and times can be found on the course calendar and are subject to change due to the nature of the course.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grading-rational">Grading Rational</h2>

<p>The final grade will be determined by your performance on homework, quizzes, exams, and the final examination. The final grade is weighted as follows:</p>

## Extra Credit

* Sometimes students ask me for an opportunity to improve their grade. Fairness dictates that each student in the class should have the same opportunities as everyone other student. Please do not ask me for special favors that will only benefit you.
-->

<h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There is no component in the grading scheme of this course for attendance. However, you will need to come to class on time in order to get the best possible grade in this class. If you miss a class for a medical reason or other valid excuse, you will be given an opportunity to make up any missing material. But if you cut class without a valid reason, your grade will suffer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only students who are registered for courses, and whose name appears on the Official Class Roster may attend courses at the University. Adelphi students make a commitment to be active participants in their educational program; class attendance is an integral part of this commitment. Students are expected to be present promptly at the beginning of each class period, unless prevented by illness or by other compelling cause. In the event of such absence, students may request that faculty members be notified by the Office of Academic Services and Retention. Students are responsible for completing course work missed through absences. Students should wait a reasonable length of time for an instructor in the event that the instructor is delayed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="students-with-disabilities">Students With Disabilities</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you have a disability that may impact your ability to carry out assigned course work, and are not enrolled in the Learning Disabilities Program, it is important that you contact the staff in the Disability Support Services Office (DSS), University Center, Room 310, (516) 877-3145. <a href="mailto:DSS@adelphi.edu">DSS@adelphi.edu</a>.

<h2 id="honor-code-statement">Honor Code Statement</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Students enrolled in this course are expected to abide by the Adelphi University Honor Code. The purpose of the Honor Code is to protect the academic integrity of the University by encouraging consistent ethical behavior in assigned coursework by students. Following is excerpted from the Student Honor Code:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The Code of Academic Honesty</li>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>The code of academic honesty prohibits behavior, which can broadly be described as lying, cheating, or stealing. Violations of the code of academic honesty will include, but are not limited to, the following:
    1. Fabricating data or citations
    2. Collaborating in areas prohibited by the professor
    3. Unauthorized multiple submission of work
    4. Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation
    5. Plagiarism: presenting any work as one’s own that is not one’s own
    6. The creation of unfair advantage
    7. The facilitation of dishonesty
    8. Tampering with or falsifying records
    9. Cheating on examinations through the use of written materials or giving or receiving help in any form during the exam, including talking, signals, electronic devices, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="student-course-evaluations">Student Course Evaluations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and
eCampus, that the course evaluation is available for your input electronically.
Availability will end at the start of the final examination period. Your feedback is valuable and I encourage you to respond. Please be assured that your responses are anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after the end of the semester and therefore after course grades have been submitted.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="general-education-learning-goals--distribution-requirements">General Education Learning Goals &amp; Distribution Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This course fulfills the Quantitative Learning Goal for General Education at Adelphi University. It also fulfills the Formal Science Distribution requirement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this course will fulfill these general education requirements for students not majoring in the sciences, please bear in mind that it was designed for students majoring in mathematics, computer science, physics and chemistry. There are other courses designed by the math and computer science department specifically for non-science majors, which would likely be more appropriate, especially Mathematical Modeling in The Sciences (Math 101 - Fall semester) and Mathematical Modeling in Human Affairs (Math 102 - Spring Semester).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="classroom-conduct">Classroom Conduct</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Conduct is important in the classroom as it is in the workplace.  In Adelphi classes, people are expected to treat others with respect and dignity at all times.  Any behavior, which is disruptive to the learning environment, is strictly prohibited.  Disruptive behavior may result in action including reduction in the final grade and/or withdrawal from class.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="religious-holidays">Religious Holidays</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Any student in this course who plans to observe a religious holiday which conflicts in any way with the course schedule or requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternative accommodations.</li>
