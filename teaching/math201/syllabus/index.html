<h2 id="catalog-description">Catalog Description</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Students are introduced to the writing of mathematics proofs, where an emphasis is placed on precise thinking and the written and oral presentation of mathematical results. Students will express abstract ideas using constructs such as logic, set theory, relations, functions, axiom systems, number theory, probability, combinatorics, and graph theory.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="course-co-requisite">Course Co-Requisite</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Grade of C- or better in Math 142 and Math 190</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Textbook.</strong>  Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof, Version 2.1 by Ted Sundstrom of Grand Valley State University. You can find the full text for free online at <a href="https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/books/9/">https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/books/9/</a>. You can also find a printed version of the book on <a href="Amazon">https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Reasoning-Writing-Proof-Version/dp/1500143413/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403533203&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=ted+sundstrom</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Supplemental Materials.</strong> To supplement the book you can find study guides and videos on the book website, <a href="https://www.tedsundstrom.com/mathreasoning">https://www.tedsundstrom.com/mathreasoning</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pie Chart Mastery.</strong> There are four checkpoints for the pie Mastery. By Feb 20, you need to have 25% of the pie completed; Mar 15, 50%; Apr 20, 75%; May 8, 100%. For example if you only have 20% of the pie completed by Feb 20, that mean you would get an 8/10 on the first Pie Goal. Similar for the other goals.</li>
  <li><strong>Objective Completions.</strong> There are 11 objectives in this course, each based on the chapters of the ebook. The due dates of these objectives are given in the ALEKS grade book and calendar. You can also find the info <a href="./docs/CourseSyllabus.pdf">on this PDF</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Exams.</strong> There will be two exams; a Midterm and Final. Both of these exams will be given on ALEKS.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grading-rational">Grading Rational</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The final grade will be determined by your performance on homework and exams. The final grade is weighted as follows:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Pie Chart</td>
              <td>45%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Objectives</td>
              <td>45%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Exams</td>
              <td>10%</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There is no component in the grading scheme of this course for attendance. However, you will need to come to class on time in order to get the best possible grade in this class. If you miss a class for a medical reason or other valid excuse, you will be given an opportunity to make up any missing material. But if you cut class without a valid reason, your grade will suffer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only students who are registered for courses, and whose name appears on the Official Class Roster may attend courses at the University. Adelphi students make a commitment to be active participants in their educational program; class attendance is an integral part of this commitment. Students are expected to be present promptly at the beginning of each class period, unless prevented by illness or by other compelling cause. In the event of such absence, students may request that faculty members be notified by the Office of Academic Services and Retention. Students are responsible for completing course work missed through absences. Students should wait a reasonable length of time for an instructor in the event that the instructor is delayed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="students-with-disabilities">Students With Disabilities</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you have a disability that may significantly impact your ability to carry out assigned coursework, please contact the Student Access Office (SAO) at 516-877-3145 or send an email to <a href="mailto:sao@adelphi.edu">sao@adelphi.edu</a>.  The staff will review your concerns and determine, with you, appropriate and necessary accommodations.  Please allow for a reasonable time frame for requesting ASL Interpreters or Transcription Services.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="course-learning-goals">Course Learning Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>These are my goals for you over the course of the semester. I would also be interested to hear any other goals you have for yourself.</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>• Students will communicate statistics effectively, both orally and in writing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>• Students will learn the basic concepts of statistics: descriptive measures, basic probability, the creation and interpretation of confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and regression models.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>• Students will take the basic concepts of statistics and learn how the theory they learned might be applied in the development of data, and most of all, in the reading, understanding and evaluation of that data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>• Students will then be able to apply their knowledge of statistics to their areas of concentration (I.E BUSINESS OR THE NATURAL SCIENCES.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="honor-code-statement">Honor Code Statement</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Students enrolled in this course are expected to abide by the Adelphi University Honor Code. The purpose of the Honor Code is to protect the academic integrity of the University by encouraging consistent ethical behavior in assigned coursework by students. Following is excerpted from the Student Honor Code:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The Code of Academic Honesty</li>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>The code of academic honesty prohibits behavior, which can broadly be described as lying, cheating, or stealing. Violations of the code of academic honesty will include, but are not limited to, the following:
    1. Fabricating data or citations
    2. Collaborating in areas prohibited by the professor
    3. Unauthorized multiple submission of work
    4. Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation
    5. Plagiarism: presenting any work as one’s own that is not one’s own
    6. The creation of unfair advantage
    7. The facilitation of dishonesty
    8. Tampering with or falsifying records
    9. Cheating on examinations through the use of written materials or giving or receiving help in any form during the exam, including talking, signals, electronic devices, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="student-course-evaluations">Student Course Evaluations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and
eCampus, that the course evaluation is available for your input electronically.
Availability will end at the start of the final examination period. Your feedback is valuable and I encourage you to respond. Please be assured that your responses are anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after the end of the semester and therefore after course grades have been submitted.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="general-education-learning-goals--distribution-requirements">General Education Learning Goals &amp; Distribution Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>This course fulfills the Quantitative Learning Goal for General Education at Adelphi University. It also fulfills the Formal Science Distribution requirement.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="classroom-conduct">Classroom Conduct</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Conduct is important in the classroom as it is in the workplace.  In Adelphi classes, people are expected to treat others with respect and dignity at all times.  Any behavior, which is disruptive to the learning environment, is strictly prohibited.  Disruptive behavior may result in action including reduction in the final grade and/or withdrawal from class.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="religious-holidays">Religious Holidays</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Any student in this course who plans to observe a religious holiday which conflicts in any way with the course schedule or requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternative accommodations.</li>
