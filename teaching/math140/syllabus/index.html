<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Website.</strong> 
The website for the course is <a href="http://math.adelphi.edu/~bstone/teaching/math140/">http://math.adelphi.edu/~bstone/teaching/math140/</a>.  All homework assignments will be posted on this site as well as solutions to quizzes, exams, and other resources and materials.  <strong>We will not be using Moodle for this course.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Text.</strong> <em><a href="../docs/precalculus2016.pdf"><strong>Precalculus</strong></a></em> written by D.H. Collingwood, K.D. Prince and M. M. Conroy
 (University of Washington). You can find the whole text in the above link. Along with the text, the authors have supplied a very useful set of materials,</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~m120/">https://sites.math.washington.edu/~m120/</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here you will find a <em>Test Archive</em> that will be helpful in studying for the exams, as well as a <em>Note to Students</em> on what to expect in this course.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Calculators.</strong>  You should have access to a scientific calculator; I recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JBNX">Texas Instruments TI-30X IIS</a>. You will not be permitted to use any device more sophisticated than this particular model on the quizzes and exams. This includes, but is not limited to, graphing calculators, phones (smart or dumb), watches, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Homework.</strong> There will be weekly homework exercises; late homework will not be accepted. 
<br />
<br /></li>
  <li><strong>Exams.</strong> There will be a total of three exams in the course. All exams will be comprehensive. The exam dates and times can be found on the course calendar and are subject to change due to the nature of the course.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grading-rational">Grading Rational</h2>

<p>The final grade will be determined by your performance on homework, quizzes, exams, and the final examination. The final grade is weighted as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Homework   </td>
              <td>50%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Exam 1</td>
              <td>15%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Exam 2</td>
              <td>15%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Final</td>
              <td>20%</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- 
The final grade will be determined by your performance on homework, quizzes, tests, and the final examination. The final grade is weighted as follows:
• 20% - on-line homework
• 15% - quizzes – sum of all quiz scores with the lowest score dropped
• 20% - midterm test on October 8
• 20% - midterm test on November 12
• 25% - final exam. Thursday, December 17, 1:00 to 3:00 pm.
Final grades are letter grades, assigned based on the numeric final grades as follows:
4
￼￼￼￼A+ 97-100% B+ 87-89% C+ 77-79% D+ 67-69% F below 60%
A 93-96% A- 90-92% B 83-86% B- 80-82% C 73-76% C- 70-72% D 63-66% D- 60-62%


## Extra Credit

* Sometimes students ask me for an opportunity to improve their grade. Fairness dictates that each student in the class should have the same opportunities as everyone other student. Please do not ask me for special favors that will only benefit you.
-->

<h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There is no component in the grading scheme of this course for attendance. However, you will need to come to class on time in order to get the best possible grade in this class. If you miss a class for a medical reason or other valid excuse, you will be given an opportunity to make up any missing material. But if you cut class without a valid reason, your grade will suffer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only students who are registered for courses, and whose name appears on the Official Class Roster may attend courses at the University. Adelphi students make a commitment to be active participants in their educational program; class attendance is an integral part of this commitment. Students are expected to be present promptly at the beginning of each class period, unless prevented by illness or by other compelling cause. In the event of such absence, students may request that faculty members be notified by the Office of Academic Services and Retention. Students are responsible for completing course work missed through absences. Students should wait a reasonable length of time for an instructor in the event that the instructor is delayed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="students-with-disabilities">Students With Disabilities</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you have a disability that may significantly impact your ability to carry out assigned coursework, please contact the Student Access Office (SAO) at 516-877-3145 or send an email to <a href="mailto:sao@adelphi.edu">sao@adelphi.edu</a>.  The staff will review your concerns and determine, with you, appropriate and necessary accommodations.  Please allow for a reasonable time frame for requesting ASL Interpreters or Transcription Services.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="course-learning-goals">Course Learning Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>These are my goals for you over the course of the semester. I would also be interested to hear any other goals you have for yourself.</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>• Students will successfully communicate mathematics through reading, writing and speaking.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>• Students will value peer collaboration and group learning while continuing to maintain a sense of self-motivation and personal understanding.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>• Students will work to solve difficult problems. Value the process of figuring them out yourself, rather
than just searching for “the answer.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>• Students will be prepared to continue to Math 141 and use the tools of precalculus as they apply
to other disciplines.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>• We will all have FUN learning Precalculus.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="honor-code-statement">Honor Code Statement</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Students enrolled in this course are expected to abide by the Adelphi University Honor Code. The purpose of the Honor Code is to protect the academic integrity of the University by encouraging consistent ethical behavior in assigned coursework by students. Following is excerpted from the Student Honor Code:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The Code of Academic Honesty</li>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>The code of academic honesty prohibits behavior, which can broadly be described as lying, cheating, or stealing. Violations of the code of academic honesty will include, but are not limited to, the following:
    1. Fabricating data or citations
    2. Collaborating in areas prohibited by the professor
    3. Unauthorized multiple submission of work
    4. Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation
    5. Plagiarism: presenting any work as one’s own that is not one’s own
    6. The creation of unfair advantage
    7. The facilitation of dishonesty
    8. Tampering with or falsifying records
    9. Cheating on examinations through the use of written materials or giving or receiving help in any form during the exam, including talking, signals, electronic devices, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="student-course-evaluations">Student Course Evaluations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and
eCampus, that the course evaluation is available for your input electronically.
Availability will end at the start of the final examination period. Your feedback is valuable and I encourage you to respond. Please be assured that your responses are anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after the end of the semester and therefore after course grades have been submitted.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="general-education-learning-goals--distribution-requirements">General Education Learning Goals &amp; Distribution Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This course fulfills the Quantitative Learning Goal for General Education at Adelphi University. It also fulfills the Formal Science Distribution requirement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this course will fulfill these general education requirements for students not majoring in the sciences, please bear in mind that it was designed for students majoring in mathematics, computer science, physics and chemistry. There are other courses designed by the math and computer science department specifically for non-science majors, which would likely be more appropriate, especially Mathematical Modeling in The Sciences (Math 101 - Fall semester) and Mathematical Modeling in Human Affairs (Math 102 - Spring Semester).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="classroom-conduct">Classroom Conduct</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Conduct is important in the classroom as it is in the workplace.  In Adelphi classes, people are expected to treat others with respect and dignity at all times.  Any behavior, which is disruptive to the learning environment, is strictly prohibited.  Disruptive behavior may result in action including reduction in the final grade and/or withdrawal from class.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="religious-holidays">Religious Holidays</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Any student in this course who plans to observe a religious holiday which conflicts in any way with the course schedule or requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternative accommodations.</li>
</ul>
